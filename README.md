# Unity-Archery
An archery script used to test rigid body and physic capabilities in the unity engine.

## Acknowledgments

* This project was fun to work on as I got to work with Rigidbodies and Physics and something about the end result was very satisfying
* I used an [asset](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/weapons/free-cartoon-weapon-pack-mobile-vr-23956) for the arrow model to save time from modeling and I applied rotation to the arrow to give it a more realistic feel. This script could be expanded easily and turned into a real bow and arrow script, which I may do in the future along with physics based bullets.
